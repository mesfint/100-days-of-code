Refreshing my HTML/CSS/Js skills, Mainly I will be doing a course given by [FrondEnd Master] (https://frontendmasters.com/bootcamp/).The course is sheduled for two weeks, I am trying to finish it on time.

### Thoughts:
So far I like the style of the course, not so detailed but as referesher its enough.Based on the schedule there in the css part creating layouts (floats and FlexBox) are going to be interesting.

==================
### R1D6 - R1D7 - 15-16/9/19

### Thoughts:
Designing simple site using HTML and external css also a blog site, The blog site is a mix of float and flexbox layout design.So far I am learing nice tricks and working habits.
