### R1D1 - 8/9/19
Today I am reading [DOMenlightment](http://domenlightenment.com/) to refresh my DOM manipulation skills, sofar I like it its so detailed.

I also coded a simple app using HTML,CSS,JavaScript.The programm counts the number of clicks of a button and updates the html page.

### R1D2 - 10-11/9/19
I make digital jsClocck, the challenge here was to figure out updating seconds every one second, then `setTimeout`come to rescue.I am planning to extend this app a little bit more useful project in the future.
