### R1D1 - 8/9/19
Today I am reading [DOMenlightment](http://domenlightenment.com/) to refresh my DOM manipulation skills, sofar I like it its so detailed.

I also coded a simple app using HTML,CSS,JavaScript.The programm counts the number of clicks of a button and updates the html page.
I had an issue that took me sometime to figureout,
1.I created a separate  method "buttonClick" and call this method in the button `onclick=buttonClick()`, But I mistakely added another "addEventListener" inside the button DOM, which is doubling everytime i click the button instead of adding "1",
